Welcome to the homepage of my [GitHub](http://github.com) [Pages](http://github.io) website.  Feel free to use the above links to explore the various sections of this site, or brows the blog posts contained below.  Use the search box at the bottom to find something more specific.

#### A Note on Accessibility With Jekyll
As the footer of every page of this site indicates, this website is powered by an open-source blogging platform called Jekyll.  This is a software package that I use to convert the text files containing the webpages and blog posts I write into what are called [static](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) (or constant) [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) webpages.  Since these webpages mostly do not change, it enables them to load faster and usually allows for more out-of-the-box accessibility with screen-readers.  However, a couple of observations could still be made:

* I believe Jekyll sites typically are not really built to support browsing on mobile phones.  This means that:
  * The header of each page is practically invisible on mobile phone internet browsers (or at least it is as tested on iPhones).  Consequently, the main pages of websites cannot be easily accessed without a direct url.
  * Some embedded videos do not play when using Safari but using Chrome usually fixes this.
  * There is a Jekyll plugin that can force websites to produce mobile-friendly versions but I don't think this is supported by Github Pages; though I am willing to stand corrected on this.
* When using either a desktop or laptop PC, Chrome does not always allow Youtube videos to play.  I am not aware of a fix for this.  Using Firefox (on Windows at least) seems to produce the most consistent results.  Using Internet Explorer works, though one may wish to be aware that IE is no longer supported by many websites now-a-days.  Microsoft Edge kind of works.
